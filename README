1 Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`collections' is a tool for synchronizing your local music collection
with MusicBrainz collections service. This allows you to keep track of
all the releases you own - and the MusicBrainz front end to
collections is most likely to change and advance in the future.

2 Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`collections' requires SQLite to be installed, as a local database is
maintained of all releases that have been added.

3 Usage
~~~~~~~
Usage of `collections' is simple:

  ./collections /path/to/music/collection

4 Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Currently only supports MP3s
